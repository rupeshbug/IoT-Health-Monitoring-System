## IoT Health Monitoring System

This project is an IoT-based health monitoring system using an Arduino. It simulates heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure using sensors (and potentiometers) and displays the readings on an LCD screen. The system provides real-time monitoring and indicates whether the values are within normal ranges or if they are high (H) or low (L) using both visual indicators (LEDs) and an LCD display.

### Project Overview
- **Components**: Arduino UNO, LCD screen, potentiometer (for simulating heart rate), temperature sensor, resistors, and LEDs.
- **Features**:
  - Monitors temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
  - Displays current readings and status (normal, high, or low) on the LCD screen.
  - Visual alerts via LEDs for abnormal readings.
